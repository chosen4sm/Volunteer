## Pro Tips

‚úÖ **Always keep days and dayDates in sync** - same number of items  
‚úÖ **Use lowercase with hyphens for experience IDs** - e.g., `"event-setup"` not `"Event Setup"`  
‚úÖ **Label is what users see** - make it friendly!  
‚úÖ **Changes take effect immediately** - no rebuild needed in dev mode
